[] new backend service singleton with stubbed apis
[] `swift build` succeeds

# Milestone 4 - fake local db in memory

Requirements
[] stubbed apis now route to a new fake class called "InMemoryDB" which fakes the sql db for now
[] app UI uses the service a little, not much though
[] `swift build` succeeds


# Milestone 5 - basic working UI finished

Requirements

[] tab 3 still does nothing
[] `swift build` succeeds


# Milestone 6 - sql backend

Requirements
[] service layer now uses skipsql to persist data and we remove the old in memory db
[] `swift build` succeeds


# Milestone 7 - third tab

Requirements
[] 3rd tab now shows simple horizontal scrolling button list at the top, one button per trackable
[] when one is selected, there is a simple table view of each day and the count (including missing days with 0)
[] the table has: date, month (jan), day of weeek (i.e. monday), count
[] `swift build` succeeds


# Milestone 8 - styling

work closly with tech lead for this (one prompting cursor)

Requirements
[] add in nice colors
[] add carrot logo
[] make polish changes


# Milestone 9 - more control

Requirements
[] top of screeen on first tab say the current day. left and right arrows allow them to change it but it defaults to the current day
[] a toggle on the first screen changes to "advanced" mode where the user doesnt' click anyonewehre on the grid icon, but instead has a + and - icon on each grid item to have more control
[] `swift build` succeeds



# Milestone 10 - export support

Requirements
[] in the 3rd tab, user should be able to export to CSV

[] copy button for csv contents
[] `swift build` succeeds


# Milestone 11 - add app info

Requirements
[] in the 3rd tab, user should have an info button which shows an info sheet
[] app info says creator is Joseph Hinkle on Dec 31th 2025
[] app version is 1.0.0
[] `swift build` succeeds


# Milestone 12 - waking cycle guard

problem: users might accidentally log a count at 1AM on Tuesday under Tuesday when it should be grouped into Monday's count. The app is meant to track counts per waking cycle

Requirements
[] when the user is between the hours of 12AM and 5AM, assume they are logging for the previous day in the first tab, but still allow them to manually click the forward arrow to log the next day (i.e. in case they just woke up very early at like 4am that day)
[] when clicking the forward arrow in that 12-5 range, show a modal which asks them "did you already sleep?" or "did you just wake up?" or something with a little explainer about how they should log based on their sleep wake cycle, not on the day hour cycle. if they say "no", then cancel the forward action. if "yes, i slept", then allow the forward move
[] `swift build` succeeds


# Milestone 13 - Allow exporting all trackables into one csv

Requirements
[] when exporting, there is an indicator on the sheet saying you are exporting just that column
[] when  exporting, there is another button which says "export all categories" which opens another sheet (reuse view component) (export all button shouldn't be present on that secondary sheet)
[] `swift build` succeeds


# Milestone 14 - Spanish support

Requirements
[] support localized spanish version
[] `swift build` succeeds


# Milestone 15 - Graphing

Users should be able to see their progress in a graph/chart

Requirements
[] New file for graphing code which supports Android/iOS simple line chart using SwiftUI only (no Swift graph / charts APIs, that way it works with Android via Skip SwiftUI)
[] Show a graph button toggle on the nav bar of the history page
[] Show the graph of that category when the toggle is on
[] Add a start and end date selector for changing the viewed range
[] `swift build` succeeds
[] `skip android build` succeeds

# Milestone 16 - General improvements

Requirements
[] Trackables should have two new properties. Color (hex string) and order (num)
[] If no order is present, just give it -1
[] If no color is present, use orange
[] Users should be able to track items to change order on goals page (2nd tab)
[] Users should be able to select the color when editing a goal
[] New goals should be auto assigned a random color
[] SQL should migrate nice so old clients still have their old data
[] SQL should still work for new clients
[] When the app is opened again (i.e. not cold open, but re-opening from multitasking), and user is on the 1st tab, move the date to the current day
[] When determining the order, use the order num in sql. If nums are the same, make it based on the id of the trackable
[] The order should be reflected in all tabs
[] `swift build` succeeds
[] `skip android build` succeeds
